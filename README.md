    * Introduction to Machine Learning (ML).
    * Python Programming.
    * Popular Python packages for ML.
    * Supervised Learning Algorithms.
    * Unsupervised Learning Algorithms.
    * Classification, Regression, and Clustering.
    * Overfitting and underfitting.
    * Dimensionality Reduction.
    * Feature Selection.
* **Final Project**: Implementation of a *research article*.

### Tasks:
1. Task 0: Python revision (NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries).
2. Task 1.0: Linear regression algorithm.
3. Task 1.1: Data preparation.
4. Task 2: KNN algorithm.

### Final Project:
